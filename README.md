# clustergram.py ·ç®
For visual inspection of how samples change clusters as a function of a parameter.

## Installation
Unpack the `clustergram` folder into your working directory, or append to your `sys.path`.

In case you're missing some of the dependencies run:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage example
```python
from clustergram import Clustergram

Clustergram().draw(x, clusters, targets=y, scoring=True, linewidth=0.5)
```

## Reference
Clustergram exposes only one function, `draw`, for which short parameter reference follows below:
```
  x                 -  x values
  clusters          -  array of the shape (n_xvals, n_samples) of cluster IDs to which each sample belongs
  targets           -  if true labels are known, colors the plot accordingly
  scoring           -  adds subplots with clustering scores using `sklearn.metrics`
  scoring_X         -  original feature array of the shape (n_samples, n_features) required for `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score`
  optimize_labeling -  for best visual results, optimize cluster labeling as to minimize number of samples changing clusters between each step
```
For remaining parameters (mostly self-explanatory) see the source.

## Example output
Clustergram with scoring plots, using data from the [zoo dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo), and the [BCPNN](https://github.com/mwielondek/BCPNN) classifier (which uses the x values as the softmax probability distribution parameter G in the transfer function).
